# Contracts

A self-hosted personal finance manager for tracking contracts, subscriptions, and purchases. Built with a Go backend and React frontend.

## Features

- **Modular design** — Separate modules for contracts and purchases, each with independent categories and dashboards
- **Contract tracking** — Store contract details including dates, pricing, notice periods, and renewal terms
- **Purchase tracking** — Track one-time purchases with item details, pricing, dealer info, and document links
- **Category organization** — Per-module categories (e.g. insurance/telecom for contracts, PC hardware/tools for purchases)
- **Homepage overview** — Dashboard at `/` with summary cards and stats across all modules
- **Renewal monitoring** — Upcoming renewals with color-coded urgency indicators
- **Email reminders** — Configurable SMTP-based reminder emails for approaching renewals
- **Batch import** — Import contracts from JSON via file upload or paste
- **Multi-user** — JWT authentication with per-user data isolation
- **Observability** — Prometheus metrics, structured logging, health/readiness probes

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Frontend | React 19, TypeScript, Vite, TanStack Router/Query, shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS |
| Backend | Go (stdlib `net/http`), BadgerDB, JWT, slog |
| Runtime | Docker, Alpine Linux |

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Go 1.25+](https://go.dev/dl/)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh)
- [Task](https://taskfile.dev) — `go install github.com/go-task/task/v3/cmd/task@latest`
- [Air](https://github.com/air-verse/air) — `go install github.com/air-verse/air@latest`

### Development

```sh
task dev
```

This starts the Go backend (port 8080) with live reload and the Vite dev server (port 5173) with API proxying. Open <http://localhost:5173>.

### Docker

```sh
task build   # build image
task up       # start with docker compose
task down     # stop
```

## Project Structure

```
frontend/          React SPA (Vite, TanStack, shadcn/ui)
backend/           Go API server (net/http, BadgerDB)
Dockerfile         Multi-stage build (Bun → Go → Alpine)
docker-compose.yml Single-service deployment with named volume
```

See `frontend/AGENTS.md` and `backend/AGENTS.md` for per-project details.
